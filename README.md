The idea of the homedesk app is to create a simple, easy to use data viz for everyday life. This example is based around keeping track of your online shop. Like Ebay, Depop, Amazon etc

## Tool Bar

Add new items by price, date, and postage, the totals will be calculated in the toolbar and added to your graph.

### Ideas

- Add a full postage cost 


## Item Data

Keep a running count of individual item types and the total sales from that count.

### Ideas

- Allow user to completely customise their individual items

## Graph

See daily totals, everytime you add a new sale it is updated to the graph along with the new date. Use the built in Matplotlib toolbar to zoom in to specific days, weeks, or years. Save a screenshot so you can share your data.

### Ideas

- Give the user the option to change between bar and line graph
- Give the user the option to change colour of the bar / line

## Calculator

Simple calculator with percentage calculations feature. This will calulcate, and take away the percentage from the calculation. (-10%, -20%, -30%) 

## Conversions

A bunch of conversions put together into little widgets.

### HomeDesk Ideas
All ideas welcome! Homedesk is meant to be the data viz or everyday life! Ideas iv had include:
- Salary / Wages
- Bills
- Personal savings
- How much money you have saved, since you have cycled to work, instead of driving or taking public transport? 

### Bugs
- Im having issues with handling the exceptions in the tool bar, if one input is incorrect the rest of the inputs are still taken into their apropriate lists causing the lists to be out of sync

### Packages
- Tkinter
- MatPlotLib
