## Tool Bar

Add new items by price, date, and postage, the totals will be calculated in the toolbar and added to your graph.

### Ideas

- Add a full postage cost 

## Item Data

Keep a running count of individual item types and the total sales from that count.

### Ideas

- Allow user to completely customise their individual items

## Graph

See daily totals, everytime you add a new sale it is updated to the graph along with the new date. Use the built in Matplotlib toolbar to zoom in to specific days, weeks, or years. Save a screenshot so you can share your data.

### Ideas

- Give the user the option to change between bar and line graph
- Give the user the option to change colour of the bar / line

## Calculator

<img width="395" alt="screen shot 2018-07-01 at 18 32 22" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35433769/42137051-903ef580-7d5d-11e8-8d2f-26627176284d.png">

Simple calculator with percentage calculations feature. This will calulcate, and take away the percentage from the calculation. (-10%, -20%, -30%) 

## Conversions

A bunch of conversions put together into little widgets.
