Add new items by price, date, and postage, the totals will be calculated in the toolbar and added to your graph.

### Ideas

- Add a full postage cost 

## Item Data

Keep a running count of individual item types and the total sales from that count.

### Ideas

- Allow user to completely customise their individual items

## Graph

See daily totals, everytime you add a new sale it is updated to the graph. Use the built in Matplotlib toolbar to zoom in to specific days, weeks, or years. Save a screenshot so you can share your data.

### Ideas

- Give the user the option to change between bar and line graph
- Give the user the option to change colour of the bar / line
